### To be done:

Major
- Remove 'employee' field from pensum instance -> 
  Additional fields: employee's f_name, l_name, abb, e-mail or any other - all read-only!
- List of Employees' plans nested into pensum's endpoint
- Additional data for non-contact hours that should be counted into pensum
- Getting language of each module for modifying hours factor before adding into pensum
- Setting up limits and pensum value and filters for employees possible to choose for plans/etc

Minor
- Implement custom filters, sorting or search
- Change upload CSV files method for employees - it should first create employees without supervisors, and then save
  supervisors to it (so employees added from list could be set as supervisors for previously added employees)
- Errors output for nested JSON data import
- Tests
