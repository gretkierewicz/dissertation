- Classes / Serializer - validation of the unique_together option with new type of HiddenField

### To be done:

- Update of Orders - no more separated view, will exist only as the sub-serializer of Modules
- Implement additional models
- Implement filters, sorting or search
- Add messages/errors
- Custom query-sets for forms (if possible)
- Change upload CSV files method for employees - it should first create employees without supervisors, and then save supervisors to it (so employees added from list could be set as supervisors for previously added employees)
- Create static function for try/except reuse (employees csv upload)
- Allow serialization of Modules with nested Orders JSON data (unique create/update methods: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#writable-nested-serializers)
