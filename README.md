- FIX - Forgot about proper filtering of modules nested into employees view

To be done:

- Create rest of methods for Orders view set
- Implement additional models
- Implement filters, sorting or search
- Add commentary
- Add messages/errors
- Implement validator for 'abbreviation' excluding polish marks (should be slugfield) - same for code in modules
