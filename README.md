- Plans - added employee's url field

### To be done:

- Implement custom filters, sorting or search
- Custom query-sets for forms (if possible)
- Change upload CSV files method for employees - it should first create employees without supervisors, and then save 
  supervisors to it (so employees added from list could be set as supervisors for previously added employees)
- Errors output for nested JSON data import
- Tests
